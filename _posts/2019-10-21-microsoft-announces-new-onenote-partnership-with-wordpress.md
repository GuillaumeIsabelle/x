> On Friday, Microsoft announced a new partnership between WordPress and its digital note-taking app, OneNote. For those unfamiliar, OneNote is part of the Microsoft Office suite, and Microsoft’s answer to Evernote–it allows users to take notes, write to-do lists, and make sketches, all of which are stored in the cloud. This makes your notes accessible across all devices. The new partnership allows WordPress users to transfer their OneNote ramblings directly into their WordPress blog.
